            <b>1. INTRODUCTION</b>
            <p>
                I learnt web development(HTML AND CSS)through module lecturer, module slides, w3school and Youtube.
                <b>Responsive design</b>
                I also learned about media screening thru
                and git hub
                <!-- design  -->
                I had no idea how to create my webpages at first because I had never designed or studied
                before, so I did some research on the portfolio web page and got some inspiration, references and started
                designing how it would appear on and what color combination would suit.

                <!-- Ups and downs -->
                I had severals problem in pushing to git branch but i solved that issue by searching in googles, later i
                have
                issue to push in origin still i cannot solved it i tried many times from youtube, google. And I
                initially struggled
                with making the hamburger icon using html and css, but I eventually got the hang of it.

                <b>Module Experience Of CSY1018</b>
                Term 1 was good because we only had one class per week.
                Despite having one class per week, the module lecturer taught us
                everything we needed to know about html and CSS.
                I've been grateful to him because in middle and high school, I never studied computers
                but he explained us each and every html and css in a very simple way .
                Not only that he went over all of the course slides with us and explained how everything worked.
                And Let's us work on code and discover what we can learn about HTML and CSS in every tutorial session.

                <b>Use of HTML and CSS</b>
                <br>
                HTML was used to primarily structure the websites. All division and section were defined by it,
                tag were used to define that how text-processing can be done the content were added through the use of
                html.CSS was used to create and give the website a fresh appearance and control of layout, text color
                and
                more.

                <b>Text-Editor</b>
                <br>
                Visual Studio Code is a text editor. It helps developers in keeping track of changes made
                during the development process, syntax highlight, error are shown in red colors,
                bracket-matching, live-server and many more.
