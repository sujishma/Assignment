            <b class="rang"> 1. Experience of learning the web development.</b>
            <br>
            <p>
                <!-- web development experience -->
                My name is Sujishma Rai. My UON id is 22430013.
                I learnt web development(HTML AND CSS) through module lecturer, module slides, w3school and Youtube.
                I also learned about media screening to make my website responsive and to push my code in github
                using gitbash.I have a lot of fun while developing this portfolio website,
                did a lot of research as it was new to me and knew about UI which is very important as it allows
                the user to interact with content.
                I also learned new things like frontend and should make webpages simple, eyecatching and easy to
                use. I'm growing more and more interest in web design and development. I finished
                my portfolio website after going over the lecture slides, tutorial and workshop sessions, my module
                lecturer, and the google, YouTube. And, by researching and finding a solution outside of the module
                I was able to complete my assignment.
                <br>

                <!-- design  -->
                <b class="rang">1.1 Design </b>
                <br>
                I had no idea how to design my webpages at first because I had never designed
                before, so I did some research on the portfolio web page on youtube and google. And got some
                inspiration, references and started designing on paper first and then with the help of Visual Studio
                Code
                i started writing code i had learnt during the class, how it would appear on and what color
                combination
                would
                suit.

                <br>

                <!-- coding and debugging -->
                <b class="rang">1.2 Coding and debugging </b>
                <br>
                I used vscode to write my code and if there was any error or where i missed to close tag it
                would show in red color not only that due to this i learned to give instructions to my laptop
                to make this webpage and with the help of live server extension of vs code, i could run the
                code i have wrote.
                <br>
                <!-- Design decision -->
                <b class="rang">1.3 Design Decision </b>
                <br>
                I have given background color #e6dfdf so while I think of giving my webpage red color suddenly I think
                of choosing random color from red section ani its not too grey like white mix of a little red so I like
                it. And to navbar rgb(45, 185, 176) I like that color and it looks good with white letter and hover too
                and its not too blue or little blue so I chose this color. And for footer I chose kind of pink color
                because pink is my favourite color so I cannot miss this. But moreover, at the end I loved all the color
                combination. I had also taken inspiration to make my indexpage from TheWebshala youtube
                channel(The WebShala, 2020). I have added font awesome
                tag in all my html pages for footer as it helps to make hamburger icon, Facebook icon, Instagram icon,
                address icon, email icon, location pin icon and phone icons as it is widely used icon easy to access in
                css, later my module lecturer told me i cannot use this so i removed from my footer but sadly i used
                fontawesome in my hamburger icon as we were told to make hamburger icon responsive so i have used
                fontawesome to make hamburger icon(Font Awesome, 2022). As i have seen one video on youtube on how to
                make ham burger icon responsive so i was inspired from codingnepal youtube to make responsive hamburger
                (CodingNepal, 2019). And i have also looked w3 school for mailto (w3school, nd). Beside these all of the
                codes and works are done by me with the help of module slides and things i have learnt in my classes.
                <br>

                <!-- Ups and downs -->
                <b class="rang">1.4 Ups and Downs </b>
                <br>
                I had severals problem in pushing to git branch but i solved that issue by searching in googles,
                later i
                have issue to push in origin still i cannot solved it i tried many times from youtube, google. And I
                initially struggled with making the hamburger icon using html and css, but I eventually got the hang
                of
                it. I tried to do some animation on the text by only rotating the transform not the content but i cannot
                make it. I searched in google and youtube about it but i couldnot find and couldnot solve the problem.

                <b class="rang">2. Module experience of CSY1018</b>
                <br>
                Term 1 was good because we only had one class per week.
                Despite having one class per week, the module lecturer taught us
                everything we needed to know about html and CSS.
                I've been grateful to him because in middle and high school, I never studied computers
                but he explained us each and every html and css in a very simple way .
                Not only that he went over all of the course slides with us and explained how everything worked.
                And Let's us work on code and discover what we can learn about HTML and CSS in every tutorial session.

                <b class="rang">2.1 Use of HTML and CSS</b>
                <br>
                HTML was used to primarily structure the websites. All division and section were defined by it,
                tag were used to define that how text-processing can be done the content were added through the use of
                html.CSS was used to create and give the website a fresh appearance and control of layout, text color
                and
                more.

                <b class="rang">2.2 Text-Editor</b>
                <br>
                Visual Studio Code is a text editor. It helps developers in keeping track of changes made
                during the development process, syntax highlight, error are shown in red colors,
                bracket-matching, live-server and many more.
